# ıntroduction

Anthocyanins also hold promise as natural colorants for food and cosmetics industries, to replace artificial and synthetic colorants that have been implicated in real or perceived medical conditions, including hyperactive behavior in children and allergy-like reactions in sensitive users.

In addition, anthocyanin usage is limited due to their color instability that is affected by various physical parameters, such as light, oxygen, and pH that can cause their interconversion between red and blue forms and lead to color loss or color changes.

While deuteration `(Chemical deuteration involves deuterating whole molecules or building blocks for the synthesis of a desired molecule by exposing them to heavy water (deuterium oxide) at high temperatures and pressures in the presence of a catalyst.)` has been shown to improve the stability of these molecules, such an approach is limited by relatively low titers of the deuterated products [@burton-freeman_chapter_2016].

Among the more than 600 anthocyanin molecules that have been identified in nature, pyranoanthocyanins are the most chemically complex. They are mostly foun in red wines and are formed during winemaking and wine maturation process by the condensation of grape anthocyanins with ceratin yeast metabolites or other compounds containing a polarizable double bond such as acetaldehyde, pyruvic acid, hydroxycinnamic acids and vinylphenols. 

Even though they exist at ppm levels in thier source, they greatly affect wine properties, such as its taste, and color. despite thier complex chemistry, their antioxidant capacity and health benefits are similar to anthocyanins found in plants showed that pyranoanthocyanins may eaisly donate an `H` to the `free radicals` and inactive them. 

Moreover, addition of `catechol` or `catechin` poriton as well as the `o-dimethoxy` motif increase thier antioxidant potential. 

`The most characteristic feature in pyranoanthocyanin structure is the formation of a fourth, pyran ring (or ring D) which provides higher color intensity and exceptional stability toward pH variations in comparison to their anthocyanin precursors.`

# Materials and Methods

## Strains and Media

*E.coli* DH5ɑ was used propagate all plasmids and LB medium (sigma) supplemented with specific antibiotics (80 μg/mL ampicillin, and 25 μg/mL chloramphenicol) depending on resistance genes used for cell growth at 37 °C. *E.coli* `BL21 Star (DE3)` and `rpoA14 (DE3)` were tested as the hosts for production of anthocyanins (C3G) and `hyrdoxylphenolic compounds (VP and VCAT),` respectively...

## Plasmid and strain constructcion

All the strains and plasmids used in this study are listed in the `Table S1`. Anthocyanin production module and phenylpropanoic acid module for *p-coumaric acid* were constructed previously in our lab. For caffeic acid production, `pZE-TH2` was used. The *`padC`* gene (phenolic acid decaroxylase, PAD) was amplified from the plasmid pJK-kanR-proJK1-PAD which was a gift feom Timothy Whitehead and was cloned into pACM4 via *`NdeI/XhoI`*. The resulting plasmid was denoted as pACM4-PAD. The primers used for PAD gene amplification were PAD_F (5ʹ-TATACATATGGGCATGGAAAACTTTAT-3ʹ) and PAD_R (5ʹ-GGTGCTCGAGTCATAAGCGACCTGCTC-3ʹ). All plasmids were transformed into host strains by the calcium chloride method and selected on LB plates with required antibiotics
