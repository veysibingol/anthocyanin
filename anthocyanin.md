# ıntroduction

Anthocyanins also hold promise as natural colorants for food and cosmetics industries, to replace artificial and synthetic colorants that have been implicated in real or perceived medical conditions, including hyperactive behavior in children and allergy-like reactions in sensitive users.

In addition, anthocyanin usage is limited due to their color instability that is affected by various physical parameters, such as light, oxygen, and pH that can cause their interconversion between red and blue forms and lead to color loss or color changes.

While deuteration `(Chemical deuteration involves deuterating whole molecules or building blocks for the synthesis of a desired molecule by exposing them to heavy water (deuterium oxide) at high temperatures and pressures in the presence of a catalyst.)` has been shown to improve the stability of these molecules, such an approach is limited by relatively low titers of the deuterated products

Among the more than 600 anthocyanin molecules that have been identified in nature, pyranoanthocyanins are the most chemically complex. They are mostly foun in red wines and are formed during winemaking and wine maturation process by the condensation of grape anthocyanins with ceratin yeast metabolites or other compounds containing a polarizable double bond such as acetaldehyde, pyruvic acid, hydroxycinnamic acids and vinylphenols. 

Even though they exist at ppm levels in thier source, they greatly affect wine properties, such as its taste, and color. despite thier complex chemistry, their antioxidant capacity and health benefits are similar to anthocyanins found in plants showed that pyranoanthocyanins may eaisly donate an `H` to the `free radicals` and inactive them. 

Moreover, addition of `catechol` or `catechin` poriton as well as the `o-dimethoxy` motif increase thier antioxidant potential. 

`The most characteristic feature in pyranoanthocyanin structure is the formation of a fourth, pyran ring (or ring D) which provides higher color intensity and exceptional stability toward pH variations in comparison to their anthocyanin precursors.`
