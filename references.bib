	abstract = {Anthocyanins are natural plant pigments imparting red, blue, and purple colors to flowers, leaves, fruits, and some vegetables. In addition to fruits and vegetables baring these colors, other sources of intake include dietary supplements and natural colorants of food and beverages. Anthocyanins have a complex metabolic fate that includes extensive presystemic metabolism giving rise to a wide range of metabolites. Anthocyanins modify the expression and activity of cellular and tissue targets influencing various systems associated with health benefits, including anticancer, vascular, metabolic, and neuronal health. Assessments of anthocyanin safety and toxicology indicate that acute toxicity is very low in animals and there are no reports indicating adverse health effects in humans with consumption of anthocyanins at usual dietary intake levels. Currently, there is no recommended intake level of anthocyanins for optimal health or to avoid adverse effects; however, future research and continued consumer interest will undoubtedly present opportunities for pursing dietary guidance recommendations.},

	abstract = {Anthocyanins are secondary metabolites and water-soluble pigments belonging to the phenolic group, with important functions in nature such as seed dispersal, pollination and development of plant organs. In addition to these important roles in plant life, anthocyanins are also used as natural pigments in various industries, due to the color palette they can produce from red to blue and purple. In addition, recent research has reported that anthocyanins have important antioxidant, anticancer, anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial properties, which can be used in the chemoprevention of various diseases such as diabetes, obesity and even cancer. However, anthocyanins have a major disadvantage, namely their low stability. Thus, their stability is influenced by a number of factors such as pH, light, temperature, co-pigmentation, sulfites, ascorbic acid, oxygen and enzymes. As such, this review aims at summarizing the effects of these factors on the stability of anthocyanins and their degradation. From this point of view, it is very important to be precisely aware of the impact that each parameter has on the stability of anthocyanins, in order to minimize their negative action and subsequently potentiate their beneficial health effects.},
